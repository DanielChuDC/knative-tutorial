[#build-build-tempalte]
== Build Template

The raw builds like what we did in previous sections has some disadvantages

 - no reusability 
 - hardcoding of build parameters 
 - inablity to make builds and services in synchronous i.e. services are deployed only after the related build is complete

One of the solution to these problems is by using **Build Templates**.

Like the build spec the knative build template spec and knative service spec also needs some customizations before apply them.

=== Generate build template 

 [source,bash]
 ----
 jsonnet maven-build-template.jsonnet \
    | yq r - | tee ../maven-build-template.yaml
 ----

The above command will generate a knative build specification as shown below:

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
apiVersion: build.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: BuildTemplate
metadata:
  name: build-java-maven
spec:
  parameters:
  - description: |
      The name of the image to push.
    name: IMAGE
  - description: |
      The context directory from where to run the build.
    name: CONTEXT_DIR
  steps:
  - args:
    - clean
    - package
    - -Duser.home=/builder/home
    - -Dimage=${IMAGE}
    image: gcr.io/cloud-builders/mvn
    name: build-maven
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /builder/home/.m2
      name: m2-cache
    - mountPath: /cache
      name: kaniko-cache
    workingDir: /workspace/${CONTEXT_DIR}
  - args:
    - --context=/workspace/${CONTEXT_DIR}
    - --dockerfile=/workspace/${CONTEXT_DIR}/Dockerfile
    - --destination=${IMAGE}
    env:
    - name: DOCKER_CONFIG
      value: /builder/home/.docker
    image: gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor
    name: docker-push
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /cache
      name: kaniko-cache
    workingDir: /workspace/${CONTEXT_DIR}
  volumes:
  - name: m2-cache
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: m2-cache
  - name: kaniko-cache
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: kaniko-cache
----

[.text-center]
**maven-build-template.yaml**

The build template does not have any hard-coded values, the dynamic values could be passed using **parameters** of the template. The build done by this build step is exactly same like what was done by previous build but this way gives flexibility i.e. the template could be modified and the builds using the template will automatically inherit the steps.

=== Generate Knative service

Run the following command to create the knative service that will use the image created by the `docker-build`.

[source,bash]
----
jsonnet --ext-str contextDir='<the context dir within the application source>' \
   --ext-str image='<the container image to use' \
   service-with-build-template.jsonnet \
    | yq r - | tee ../service-with-build-template.yaml
----

(e.g.) 

[source,bash]
----
jsonnet --ext-str contextDir='java/springboot' \
   --ext-str image='docker.io/demo/event-greeter:0.0.2' \
   service-with-build-template.jsonnet \
    | yq r - | tee ../service-with-build-template.yaml
----

Running the above command will result in the following knative service:

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: event-greeter
spec:
  runLatest:
    configuration:
      build:
        apiVersion: build.knative.dev/v1alpha1
        kind: Build
        spec:
          serviceAccountName: build-bot
          source:
            git:
              revision: v0.0.2 # <1>
              url: https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/knative-tutorial-event-greeter.git
          template:
            arguments: # <2>
              - name: IMAGE
                value: docker.io/demo/event-greeter:0.0.2
              - name: CONTEXT_DIR
                value: java/springboot
            name: build-java-maven # <3>
          timeout: 20m
      revisionTemplate:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: event-greeter
        spec:
          container:
            image: docker.io/kameshsampath/event-greeter:0.0.2
----

[.text-center]
**service-with-build-template.yaml**

<1> Using another branch from the sources, just to differentiate the image produced by this build
<2> Passing the parameters required by the build template, not passing the required parameters will result in build validation failure
<3> The name of the build template to use

[#build-template-apply-resources]
=== Apply resources

Since we have already <<build-apply-preeq-resouces,applied the pre-req>> resouces, lets jump straight to applying the template and service.

=== Create build template

[source,bash]
----
oc apply -n knativetutorial -f maven-build-template.yaml
----

[.text-center]
**(OR)**

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -n knativetutorial -f maven-build-template.yaml
----

[#build-see-what-you-have-deployed]
=== See what you have deployed

[#build-show-knative-build-templates]
==== build templates
include::_knative-objects.adoc[leveloffset=+1,tag=knative-build-templates]

[#build-deploy-service-build-template]
==== Deploy service using Build Template

With build templates the build not be triggered unless some service or build referring to it gets created, run the following commands to deploy the service:

[source,bash]
----
oc apply -n knativetutorial -f service-with-build-template.yaml
----

[.text-center]
**(OR)**

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -n knativetutorial -f service-with-build-template.yaml
----

After successful deployment of the service we should see a Kubernetes deployment called `event-greeter-00001-deployment` available in the OpenShift dashboard:

[.thumb]
image::event-greeter-00001.png[Event Greeter Service]

[#build-invoke-service]
=== Invoke Service

You can <<build-invoke-service,Invoke Service>> the same way you did for builds. But the responses will be slightly different from build as we used a different image.

[source,json]
----
{
    "host": "Event greeter v0.0.2 => 'event-greeter-00001-deployment-7687c8dc8d-jpcm9' : 1 ",
    "message": "test message"
}
----

[#build-template-cleanup]
=== Cleanup
[source,bash]
----
oc -n knativetutorial delete services.serving.knative.dev event-greeter
oc -n knativetutorial delete buildtemplates.build.knative.dev build-java-maven
----

[.text-center]
**(OR)**

[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n knativetutorial delete services.serving.knative.dev event-greeter
kubectl -n knativetutorial delete buildtemplates.build.knative.dev build-java-maven
----

NOTE: You can also delete <<build-apply-preeq-resouces,pre-req resources>> that were created if you dont need them.
