== Configurations, Routes and Traffic distribution

At the end of this chapter you will be able to understand and know how to :

* Deploying Knative configurations and routes separately 
* Distributing traffic between revisions of the service

[#crtd-deploy-configuration]
=== Deploy Configuration

In previous chapter we saw how we can deploy service using holistic service resource file, in this chapter we will see how to deploy the service using configurations and resource files.

Navigate to folder `$TUTORIAL_HOME/02-configs-and-routes`:

==== Deploy Configuration revision 1

The following snippet how a Knative configuration resource YAML will look like:

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: greeter
spec:
  revisionTemplate:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: greeter
    spec:
      container:
        image: dev.local/rhdevelopers/greeter:0.0.1 #<1>
----

[.text-center]
**configuration-rev1.yaml**

<1> It is very important that the image is a fully qualified name docker image name with tag. For more details on this <<faq-q2,Question 2 of FAQ>>

The service could be deployed using the command:

[source,bash]
----
oc apply -n knativetutorial -f config/configuration-rev1.yaml
----

[.text-center]
**(OR)**

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -n knativetutorial -f config/configuration-rev1.yaml
----

After successful deployment of the service we should see a Kubernetes deployment called `greeter-00001-deployment` available in the OpenShift dashboard:

image::greeter-00001.png[Greeter Service]

[#crtd-invoke-service]
=== Invoke Service

include::./_invokeservice.adoc[leveloffset=+1,tags=*]

The command will return HTTP 404 as there are no routes deployed yet. Let us now deploy a route

[#crtd-deploy-route]
=== Deploy Route
Let us now deploy a default route that will route all the traffic to  service deployed via configuration `greeter`

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: greeter
spec:
  traffic:
    - configurationName: greeter
      percent: 100
----

[.text-center]
**route_default.yaml**

[source,bash]
----
oc apply -n knativetutorial -f route/route_default.yaml
----

[.text-center]
**(OR)**

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -n knativetutorial -f route/route_default.yaml
----

<<invoke-service,Invoking Service>> now should return a response like **Hi greeter => greeter-00001-deployment-5d696cc6c8-m65s5: 1**

NOTE: Sometimes the response might not be returned immediately especially when the pod is coming up from dormant state, at those times try giving request again

[#crtd-see-what-you-have-deployed]
=== See what you have deployed

The holistic service base deployment strategy that we did now will create the following resource objects:

[#crtd-show-knative-services]
==== service 
include::_knative-objects.adoc[tag=knative-services]

The command will throw an error as there are no knative services deployed as part of configuration+routes based deployment strategy. 

[#crtd-show-knative-configs]
==== configuration
include::_knative-objects.adoc[tag=knative-configs]

[#crtd-show-knative-routes]
==== routes
include::_knative-objects.adoc[tag=knative-routes]

When the service was invoked with `curl -H "Host: greeter.knativetutorial.example.com" $IP_ADDRESS`,  you noticed that we added a **Host** header to the curl with value `greeter.knativetutorial.example.com`, this FQDN is automatically assigned to your Knative service by the Knative Routes.   It follows a format `<service-name>.<namespace>.<domain-suffix>`.

[NOTE]
====
* The domain suffix in this case __example.com__ is configurable via the config map **config-domain** of **knative-serving** namespace.
====

[#crtd-show-knative-revisions]
==== revisions
include::_knative-objects.adoc[tag=knative-revisions]

[TIP]
====
* add `-oyaml` to the commands above to see more details
====

[#crtd-deploying-new-revision]
=== Deploy new Revision Service

For the new revision of the service we will add an environment variable to the service deployment. As Knative follows 12-Factor application principles, any new configuration change will trigger new deployment, in this case it is the new environment variable.

==== Deploy configuration revision 2 
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: greeter
spec:
  revisionTemplate:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: greeter
    spec:
      container:
        image: dev.local/rhdevelopers/greeter:0.0.1
        env: #<1>
          - name: MESSAGE_PREFIX
            value: Hello
----

[.text-center]
**configuration-rev2.yaml**

<1> Adding an environment variable that will be used a message prefix

Let us deploy the new revision using the command:

[source,bash]
----
oc apply -n knativetutorial -f config/configuration-rev2.yaml
----

[.text-center]
**(OR)**

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -n knativetutorial -f config/configuration-rev2.yaml
----

After successful deployment of the service we should see a Kubernetes deployment called `greeter-00002-deployment` available in the OpenShift dashboard:

image::greeter-00002.png[Greeter Service rev2]

Now running the <<show-knative-revisions,command>> will show two revisions namely `greeter-00001` and `greeter-0002`.

<<invoke-service,Invoking Service>> will now show an output like **Hello greeter => greeter-00002-deployment-8d9984dc8-rgzx6: 2**, where __Hello__ is the value that we configured via environment variable in the Knative service resource file.

[#crtd-distributing-traffic]
=== Distributing traffic

When deploying services with service object based approach, the service deployment will take care of traffic distribution either 100% to latest or pinned revision.  In this section we will explore how we can deploy routes to distribute traffic between deployed revisions.

[NOTE]
====
For the sake of clarity we will call greeter-00001 as **revision 1** and greeter-00002 as **revision 2**
====

Before we start to apply routes, let us open a new terminal and run the following command `$TUTORIAL_HOME/02-configs-and-routes/bin/call.sh`, this command will keep sending requests to greeter service in every two seconds which allows us to monitor the changes to responses as we keep applying the route that will distribute the traffic between available two revisions.

[#crtd-all-rev1]
==== All traffic to revision 1
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -n knativetutorial -f route/route_all_rev1.yaml
----

[.text-center]
**(OR)**

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -n knativetutorial -f route/route_all_rev1.yaml
----

You will notice the output on your other terminal to be something like **Hi greeter => greeter-00001-deployment-5d696cc6c8-m65s5: 34**.

[#crtd-all-rev2]
==== All traffic to revision 2
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -n knativetutorial -f route/route_all_rev2.yaml
----

[.text-center]
**(OR)**

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -n knativetutorial -f route/route_all_rev2.yaml
----

You will notice the output on your other terminal to be something like **Hello greeter => greeter-00002-deployment-8d9984dc8-rgzx6: 13**.

[#crtd-all-rev1-rev2-50]
==== 50-50 between revision 1 and revision 2
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -n knativetutorial -f route/route_rev1-50_rev2-50.yaml
----

[.text-center]
**(OR)**

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -n knativetutorial -f route/route_rev1-50_rev2-50.yaml
----

You will notice the output will be mix of responses like **Hi greeter => greeter-00001-deployment-5d696cc6c8-m65s5: 11** and **Hello greeter => greeter-00002-deployment-8d9984dc8-rgzx6: 10** approximately distributed 50% between each.

[#crtd-all-rev1-rev2-75-25]
==== 75-25 between revision 1 and revision 2
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -n knativetutorial -f route/route_rev1-75_rev2-25.yaml
----

[.text-center]
**(OR)**

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -n knativetutorial -f route/route_rev1-75_rev2-25.yaml
----

You will notice the output will be mix of responses like **Hi greeter => greeter-00001-deployment-5d696cc6c8-m65s5: 6** and **Hello greeter => greeter-00002-deployment-8d9984dc8-rgzx6: 7**, with more requests responded by revision  1 approximately distributed 75% to 25 % between revision 1 and revision 2.

[#crtd-all-rev1-rev2-10-90]
==== 10-90 between revision 1 and revision 2
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -n knativetutorial -f route/route_rev1-10_rev2-90.yaml
----

[.text-center]
**(OR)**

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -n knativetutorial -f route/route_rev1-10_rev2-90.yaml
----

You will notice the will be mix of responses like **Hi greeter => greeter-00001-deployment-5d696cc6c8-m65s5: 4** and **Hello greeter => greeter-00002-deployment-8d9984dc8-rgzx6: 5**, with more requests responded by revision 2 approximately 10% to 90% between revision 1 and revision 2.

[NOTE]
====
In response texts e.g **Hi greeter => greeter-00001-deployment-5d696cc6c8-m65s5: 4** the numbers at the end of the responses shows a count of now may requests has been handled by the service in this example  it is __4__.  Also note that the output count number may vary according to number of requests that you might have issued.
