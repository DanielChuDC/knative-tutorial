[#download-tutorial-sources]
== Download Tutorial Sources
Before we start setting up the environment, let's clone the tutorial sources and set the `TUTORIAL_HOME` environment variable to point to the root directory of the tutorial:

[#cloneRepo]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git clone https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/knative-tutorial 
----
copyToClipboard::cloneRepo[]

The `work` folder in `$TUTORIAL_HOME` can be used to download the demo application resources and refer to them during the exercises. The `work` folder has a README with instructions on the source code repo and git commands to clone the sources.
