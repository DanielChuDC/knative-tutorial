At the end of this chapter you will be able to understand and know how to :

* Deploy first Knative service ?
* Deploying multiple revisions of the service
* What different service deployment strategies possible (service vs configurations/routes) ?
* Always running latest vs pinning revision to services

[#basics-prerequisite]
== Prerequisite 
include::partial$prereq-cli.adoc[]

[#basics-build-containers]
== Build Containers
include::partial$build-containers.adoc[tag=greeter]

[#basics-deploy-service]
== Deploy Service

Navigate to folder `$TUTORIAL_HOME/01-basics/knative`.

The following snippet shows how a Knative service YAML will look like:

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: greeter
spec:
  runLatest: #<1>
    configuration:
      revisionTemplate:
        spec:
          container:
            image: dev.local/rhdevelopers/greeter:0.0.1 #<2>
----

[.text-center]
**service.yaml**

<1> Makes Knative to always run the latest revision of the deployment
<2> It is very important that the image is a fully qualified name docker image name with tag. For more details on this xref:ROOT:faq.adoc#faq-q2[Question 2 of FAQ]

The service could be deployed using the command:

[source,bash,linenums]
----
oc apply -n knativetutorial -f service.yaml
----

[.text-center]
**(OR)**

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -n knativetutorial -f service.yaml
----

After successful deployment of the service we should see a kubernetes deployment called `greeter-00001-deployment` available.

[#basics-invoke-service]
== Invoke Service
include::partial$invoke-service.adoc[tag=*]

The last curl command should return a response like **Hi greeter => greeter-00001-deployment-5d696cc6c8-m65s5: 1**

NOTE: Sometimes the response might not be returned immediately especially when the pod is coming up from dormant state, at those times try giving request again

[#basics-see-what-you-have-deployed]
== See what you have deployed

The service based deployment strategy that we did now will create many knative resources, the following commands will help you to query and find what has been deployed.

[#basics-show-knative-services]
=== service 
include::partial$knative-objects.adoc[tag=knative-services]

[#basics-show-knative-configs]
=== configuration
include::partial$knative-objects.adoc[tag=knative-configs]

[#basics-show-knative-routes]
=== routes
include::partial$knative-objects.adoc[tag=knative-routes]

When the service was invoked with `curl -H "Host: greeter.knativetutorial.example.com" $IP_ADDRESS`,you noticed that we added a **Host** header to the request with value `greeter.knativetutorial.example.com`,this FQDN is automatically assigned to your Knative service by the Knative Routes,it uses the format like `**<service-name>.<namespace>.<domain-suffix>**`.

[NOTE]
====
* The domain suffix in this case __example.com__ is configurable via the config map **config-domain** of **knative-serving** namespace.
====

[#basics-show-knative-revisions]
=== revisions
include::partial$knative-objects.adoc[tag=knative-revisions]

[TIP]
====
* add `-oyaml` to the commands above to see more details

[#deploying-new-revision]
== Deploy new Revision Service

As Knative follows https://12factor.net[12-Factor] application principles, any new https://12factor.net/config[configuration] change will trigger new revision of the deployment. 
 
To deploy a new revision of the greeter service, we will add an environment variable to the existing service as shown below:

[#basics-service-rev2]
=== Service revision 2
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: greeter
spec:
  runLatest:
    configuration:
      revisionTemplate:
        spec:
          container:
            image: dev.local/rhdevelopers/greeter:0.0.1
            env:
             - name: MESSAGE_PREFIX #<1>
               value: Hello
----
[.text-center]
**service-env.yaml**

<1> Adding an environment variable that will be used a message prefix

Let us deploy the new revision using the command:

[source,bash]
----
oc apply -n knativetutorial -f service-env.yaml
----

[.text-center]
**(OR)**

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -n knativetutorial -f service-env.yaml
----

After successful deployment of the service we should see a kubernetes deployment called `greeter-00002-deployment` available in the OpenShift dashboard:

image::greeter-00002.png[Greeter Service rev2]

Now running the <<basics-show-knative-revisions,command>> will show two revisions namely `greeter-00001` and `greeter-0002`.

<<basics-invoke-service,Invoking Service>> will now show an output like **Hello greeter => greeter-00002-deployment-8d9984dc8-rgzx6: 2**, where __Hello__ is the value that we configured via environment variable in the Knative service resource file.

[#basics-pinning-revision]
== Pinning service to a revision

As you noticed that the Knative services always routes the traffic to the **latest** revision of the service deployment, thats because of the **runLatest** attribute in <<basics-service-rev2,service resource file>>.

Let us now make the greeter service use earlier revision `greeter-00001`. 

[TIP]
====
You can use the get xref:ROOT:knative-objects.adoc#knative-revisions[show knative revisions] command to find the available revisions for the greeter service.
====

=== Service pinned to revision 1

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: greeter
spec:
  pinned: #<1>
    revisionName: greeter-00001
  configuration:
    revisionTemplate:
      spec:
        container:
          image: dev.local/rhdevelopers/greeter:0.0.1
----
[.text-center]
**service-pinned-rev1.yaml**

<1> The **pinned** attribute in service resource file will make Knative use the revision specified in the **revisionName** attribute.

Let redeploy the greeter service to be pinned to revision __greeter-00001__:

[source,bash]
----
cd $TUTORIAL_HOME/knative
----

[source,bash]
----
oc apply -n knativetutorial -f service-pinned-rev1.yaml
----

[.text-center]
**(OR)**

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -n knativetutorial -f service-pinned-rev1.yaml
----

<<basics-invoke-service,Invoking Service>> will now show an output like **Hi greeter => greeter-00001-deployment-5d696cc6c8-m65s5: 3**.

[#basics-cleanup]
== Cleanup
[source,bash]
----
oc -n knativetutorial delete services.serving.knative.dev greeter
----

[.text-center]
**(OR)**

[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n knativetutorial delete services.serving.knative.dev greeter
----
